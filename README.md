# WebGuesser

In this introductory level project, you’ll use Sinatra to build a number guessing game.

## Goals

It will:

- Generate a random number on startup
- Have a web page where you can enter a guess
- Tell you whether your guess was…
    - Way too high
    - Too high
    - Correct
    - Too low
    - Way too low

## Iteration 0: Generating the Number

When we start a project we like to work in iterations. You can think of an iteration like a draft when you’re writing a
paper. The goal of Iteration 0 is to get the program doing **something** successfully.

In this iteration, let’s focus on:

- Beginning the Sinatra app
- Generating the random number
- Storing that number
- Displaying the number

## Iteration 1: Generating the Number

Our program should generate the secret number when it first starts up. Let’s start with a number between 0 and 100.

## I2: Using ERB and HTML

Let’s move toward letting the user actually put in a guess and give feedback.
